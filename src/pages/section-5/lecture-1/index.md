# 5. Controlling Animation with JavaScript

## Learning Objectives for this Section
- Learn how to dynamically control animations: **sequential execution, pause, restart, and reverse**
- Understand how to **change animation speed** and implement animations that are consistent regardless of performance


## 🤔 Scenario 1: Dynamic Animation Control (Sequence, Pause, Reverse)

- **Situation**: You want to control running animations interactively based on user actions.
- **Questions**:  
  - Can you pause or restart an animation with a button click?
  - Can you find out the progress of the animation?
  - Can you make the second animation start a few seconds after the first animation ends?
  - Is it possible to implement **reverse (playback in the opposite direction)** during an animation?
  - Is this possible with pure CSS, or do you need JavaScript?
- **Example**:  
  - An element moving to the right instantly reverses to the left when a button is clicked.

## 🤔 Scenario 2: Animation Speed Control

- **Situation**: You want to change the animation speed in real time and ensure consistent results regardless of device performance.
- **Questions**:  
  - Can you make the animation speed up or slow down while it is running?
  - How can you guarantee that, regardless of the user's computer or browser load,  
    the element always reaches the same position/state at the same time?
- **Example**:  
  - An animation that always reaches the same position after 3 seconds, no matter the performance.
